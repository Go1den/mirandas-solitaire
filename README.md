Solitaire game written in 

2 decks
7 cards in top row, 7 in bottom
Middle of the bottom is facing down (draw pile)
Any time you flip over a number card in natural spot, then you add an extra card to face down pile
Any time you flip an ace up, an extra card in the down pile
(Ace in the ace spot = 2 cards)
Every time you get to the draw pile or through the two rows, extra card in the draw pile
Keep dealing until you run out

To play:
Counting up Ace->King in each suit
Counting down King->Ace in each suit

To start with, any kings or aces go to the top, and anything that can play on them

When you can't play, Draw from the draw pile, put it at the bottom of that number's pile, then fan those cards out and play any that play from that fanned pile or any of the other tops of the other piles

When you run out of draw pile cards, you can trade cards across the scored piles to try to produce a new valid play
